# BestApps

### Description

BestApps is a prototype for a mobile application for app-recommendation, similar to AppsZoom (for Android). The core functionalities of the mobile app are:

- Displaying user ratings, downloads, and other public information about the give mobile app.
- Displaying BestApps ratings, and app reviews, based on two criterias: usability, user experience and also, an overall rating about the app is given. (Ratings and reviews will be added by BestApps team, or by members selected from BestApps team).
- Apps are grouped by categories, there are tabs for top downloaded and top rated apps. Also, there is an option for displaying the number of apps, by category, number of top rated apps or number of top downloaded apps.

We have created BestApps using [Ionic Framework 1.3.1](http://ionicframework.com/)

### Installation

BestApps is still not released for any mobile app platform, but you can test it on Ionic View (you need to send us an e-mail, so we can share the app with you), or on your non-mobile device by installing ionic, and using the following command to run it:
```sh
$ ionic serve --lab
```
